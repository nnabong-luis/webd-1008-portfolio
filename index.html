          <h3>IGOO'S OUTREACH PROGRAM</h3>
          <p>
            As part of our initiative to help our community, Igoo's hosted the "Yummy in my Tummy" program to extend our
            hands to our "Kabayans" out there
            that maintains our lovely beaches in Jomalig Island, Quezon Provice, Philippines. We thanked the community
            governing Jomalig for their hospitality.

          <h3>COVID PRECAUTIONS</h3>
          <p>
            All of us at Igoo's really care for our customers health, that is why our stores will be limiting the
            capacity to dine inside our restaurants.
            We are also adhering to government mandated laws to put health and safety first before anything else. We
            encourage our customers to order using
            partnered food delivery services to avail our products. As a way to say "Stay Safe", we'll be shouldering
            your delivery fee for a limited period.
            Please use the code "IGOOS_DELIVERS" upon checkout.
